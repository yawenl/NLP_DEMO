Oct 24:
Finish half of FindProposition() function to help creating new clauses based on name annotation.
Note that CreateClause(ArrayList<Clause> ClauseList, Integer index_start, Integer index_end) takes in 
index_start and index_end to build new clause based on old existing clauses. index_start should be the 
index of the proposition before the defined word clause. FindProposition() helps finding index of the 
proposition.

Things to do:
- get the word node of provided word_index in FindProposition() is not finished
---------
- Replace which/that with the actual object
- Add subject when one clause does not have one
How: which has a relation (nsubjpass) with the verb
verb has a relation (acl:relcl) with the subject
